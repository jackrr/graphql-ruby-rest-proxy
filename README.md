# GraphQL REST API Proxy for Ruby

WIP WIP WIP

Utilities to resolve fields from external APIs.

Built as an extension to the wonderful [graphql-ruby]https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby gem, to allow you to conveniently work with data from remote RESTful APIs as though they coexisted in your ActiveRecord database.

Motivation documented here: https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/3719
