# GraphQL REST API Proxy for Ruby

Utilities to resolve fields from external APIs.

Built as an extension to the wonderful [graphql-ruby]https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby gem, to allow you to conveniently work with data from remote RESTful APIs as though they coexisted in your ActiveRecord database.
